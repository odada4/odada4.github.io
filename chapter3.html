    <h2>CHAPTER THREE</h2>
    <section  class="col1">
    <p>“Come and see! Come and see!” Titi cried as she shook me awake.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>	“Come and see!” She continued, almost dragging me off the bed.</p>
<p>	“What is it?”</p>
<p>	“Kittens. We found six of them in daddy’s car.”</p>
<p>	I jumped up and grabbed her shoulders. “Where are they now? Where is Grandmother?”</p>
<p>	“She just went out. She said Kokonsari will come back with her. We are going to take care of them.”</p>
<p>	I emptied the box of clothes and rushed out to the car. The rain had cleaned off the mud and I could see the interior. Titi caught up and couldn’t stop yammering on about how happy she was to finally have new pets.</p>
<p>“Grandmother said we should leave them there.”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Titi!” I opened the door.</p>
<p>Titi giggled. “Are we going to keep them?”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>I moved closer in and stroked the kittens. They didn’t recoil. Good. I opened the box and reached for the first one.</p>
<p>“But I can have one. I told Grandmother I want one.”</p>
<p>“No.” I lowered the creature into the box. It perched, looking content. “All your pets end up dead anyway.”</p>
<p>“But it’s not me who kills them,” she protested.</p>
<p>“So?” I yelled in her face.</p>
<p>Her face soured. “But where are you taking them? Grandmother said they’ll be fine here.”</p>
<p>I scoffed. “Do you know what Kokonsari will do to them?”</p>
<p>She looked puzzled. “Is he going to sell them?”</p>
<p>I shook my head and told her. “And remember what Mrs. Abayomi said at Sunday school last week? Charms are evil. If you contribute to them, you’re helping the devil. And you’ll die and go to hell.”</p>
<p>Her face turned penitent, then sulky. I set the third kitten in the box and stroked its head. It demurred.</p>
<p>“But where are you taking them?” she continued, her voice cracking.</p>
<p>I didn’t answer. I knew she loved cats. All her books had drawings and pictures of cats and tiger cubs. She read Batman comics at the school library only because of Catwoman, and ever since she heard Skimbleshanks on the radio, it stuck her head like a tumor. But I didn’t care. The vigilantes wouldn’t let her keep it, anyway.</p>
<p>The last kitten was curled up as though it was sick or cold. It didn’t look eager to come with me like the others had. I banged my fist on the seat to startle it. It didn’t move. I stooped and stretched out my hands, then I pulled out a long rotting branch from under the car.</p>
<p>“Don’t beat it!” Titi screamed and grabbed my arm. I freed myself and drew the kitten closer with the stick, then lifted it off the seat. It meowed and squealed as I dropped it on top of its siblings and closed the box.</p>
<p>“Please keep it open,” she pleaded. “Let them breathe. Where are you taking them?”</p>
<p>“None of your business.” I picked up the box and started walking. She followed.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“Leave me alone.”</p>
<p>“Shalanga!” She hollered, correctly predicting my destination.</p>
<p>“None of your business!”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>“Okay, now you’re irritating me. It’s none of your business. Go away!”</p>
<p>“No! Grandmother said we should leave them in the car. Why are you taking them there?”</p>
<p>“Shut up! I told you what those people will do with them.”</p>
<p>“You’re lying. I’ll tell Grandmother.” She burst into tears and ran out into Cinema Road.</p>
<p>I stood there for a while, pondering her words and watching her run off. I wondered if I could do anything else. I had an idea what my uncle could do if I followed through. But there was no question about what would happen to the innocent things I was carrying if I gave them up. Growing annoyed with the meowing in the box, I shook it to quiet the movement inside. Then I strode a few more yards and kicked open the door to the outhouse.</p>
<p>I didn’t mind the stench. I had grown used to it. But the movement in the box became more frantic and the meowing grew louder. I set the box down and lifted the wooden square plank covering the hole. The mixture of human waste, rainwater and residual harmattan humidity filled the windowless shed. I breathed out again, making no conscious effort to take in air while I grabbed a long stick leaning against the wall and plunged it in the hole. </p>
<p>“Thank God it rained,” I muttered. The bottom had softened and swirled very easily as I stirred with the stick. I could hear the kittens clambering over one another. Soon! It’s going to be all well! Don’t worry. I replaced the stick and spat in the hole, and then opened the box and pulled out the first kitten by the tail.</p>
