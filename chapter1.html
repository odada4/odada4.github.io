    <h2>CHAPTER ONE</h2>
    <section  class="col1">
    <p>A hen with the feathers pulled off her neck hustled down the road with six chicks in tow, their miniature tufts flaring as cars and motorcycles zipped past, blowing them closer towards the algae-clogged gutter that was once the sidewalk. I yawned again, wondering, as I took a break from sweeping, and leaned against the rails of the balcony overlooking the street, where they were in such haste to get to. “It’s shameful enough that the cock has to wake you in the morning,” Grandmother once said. “But for the hen to get to work while you’re still in bed!? Eèwọ̀o!” Of course, it wouldn’t be prudent to ask her what “work” the hen did, so I just nodded and said “Yes, ma.”</p>
<p>	A seventh chick hobbled on about twenty meters behind the pack. It bobbed and weaved its way around two veiled women, both rushing to get to the mosque for Fajr before the sun completely  dusted off all the leftover shades of darkness from dawn. As it moved quicker and seemed to gain on the rest of the pack, a large pair of black wings swooped in. Talons bore down, the startled women scampered, and the hapless chick writhed in the hawk’s clutch as they both slowly dissolved into the sky.</p>
<p>Frenetic screams and cheers followed them from the people on the street, but the hen and the rest of her chicks trotted on, oblivious to their loss.</p>
<p>My eyes swept excitedly through the crowd and found Mukaila. I waved at him. He smiled and waved back with his long curved knife. “You wan come?” He asked, pointing to a ram tied to an almond tree.</p>
<p>I wanted to. I’d always wanted him to teach me how to slaughter a ram or a goat. And now I needed to ask him if hawks snatched kittens too. He would know. He always knew things like that. But I shook my head and motioned behind me. Grandmother had warned me to never hang out with him. “He smokes Indian hemp! Don’t you see his eyes?” When I suggested that his ever-red eyes might be a result of smoke from the firewood he and his mother cooked with every day, she smacked my head with a broom. No, I signalled. I was content just to watch from here.</p>
<p>The rest of the day dawned as it always did. Titi never got out of bed until well after six o’clock, but I had to be up before by five to sweep out the house and scrub the bathroom. “She’ll soon be old enough,” Grandmother said whenever I grumbled. She was six years old already, I would retort. On mornings when she wasn’t so patient, she brandished her cane and I shut up. As she squatted on the concrete floor in her outdoor kitchen that morning, chopping and disembowelling fresh mackerels for me to take to my Aunty Afusa, my uncle’s wife at Sonariwo market, I sat in front of the door, watching bats relieve themselves on Dad’s old volkswagen while they hung upside down from Grandmother’s mango tree.</p>
<p>For the first time, I was happy that they shit on Dad’s car. I even hoped they could aim more at the windshield so nobody could see what I had hidden inside the car. I’d check on them when I got back from the market. I used to hurl stones at the bats and they would fly away, then they’d be back within ten minutes. But since Kokonsari started bringing his gun on Sundays, I stopped detesting them so much. Who would, when they were so delicious? And even now, I needed them to stay and cover my stuff.</p>
<p>Kokonsari was Grandmother’s younger brother, an officer in the town’s vigilante group and one of the few Yoruba people I knew who lived in Sabo, the part of town where Hausa immigrants lived, almost four miles from our house. He was much younger than Grandmother and only slightly older than Dad. Grandmother playfully dubbed him gambari - an epithet for Hausa people.</p>
<p>“Aunty mi,” he would whine. “I don’t like it o! Stop comparing me to those dirty people!”</p>
<p>“Why do you live among them, then?”</p>
<p>“Is it not because of my work? You people should be grateful, sef! If nobody is watching them, they will just start robbing and stabbing normal people in their houses.”</p>
<p>Most Saturdays, he brought us lunch. But recently, he’d also been bringing his shakabula. And for an hour or two, we would stand under the mango tree and shoot down bats -- often with me pointing and him shooting. The gun’s nasty boom always made Titi nervous, so she would sit in Grandmother’s room and turn the radio on loud until I went in to fetch her. Sometimes, Kokonsari would let me handle the gun and coach me when Grandmother wasn’t watching.</p>
<p>	“Óyá, just scope it,” he would say, holding my shoulders and adjusting my stance. Yes o! Like that. No, no, you will wound yourself o! Óyá! Shoot!”</p>
<p>When I pulled the trigger, my ears would ring like the sirens that blared when the soldiers were driving their iron trucks to the bank. But it was always exhilarating. And even though my kill included more tree branches than bats, he would always congratulate me.</p>
<p>	“Correct! Don’t worry, you are getting good. You’ll be useful when you grow up and shoot all those bastard gambaris that sent your father away.”</p>
<p>	I wasn’t sure how to respond whenever he said that. Of course, I wanted to shoot them, but wasn’t I old enough now? Dad fled because they were trying to kill him, so why couldn’t we just kill them so he could come back?</p>
<p>	“Do you know when he’s coming back?” I asked once.</p>
<p>	“Oh not too long,” he said very quickly.</p>
<p>	“Like when?”</p>
<p>	He jerked his neck from side to side and squeezed my shoulder. “Look, MKO will get out of prison very soon. Once he gets out and becomes President, your father will come home.”</p>
<p>	That had to happen soon, I imagined. It had taken less than a year between MKO winning the election and Abacha staging a coup and locking him up while killing, exiling and silencing many of his supporters. But three years had passed since. Abacha was going to be killed soon, and all his gambari tribesmen were going down with him. I really believed so. I just couldn’t wait until I was old enough.</p>
<p>Kokonsari and I would roast the bats over firewood behind the garbage drums in the yard, because we could find dry rubbish on top of the heap to feed the fire with. But when the rains started, grandmother let us use her kerosene stove, but only on the condition that Kokonsari fill its four-litre tank to capacity every week.</p>
<p>“Thank you all today,” I mumbled in the direction of the tree as the rustle of a plastic bag told me Grandmother was almost ready. “But some of you have to pay tomorrow.” Knives clinked against each other and settled on wood; water splashed on the floor; a broom swished over the concrete and bloodied water streamed out from under the door. Grandmother grunted as she always did when she straightened up.</p>
<p>	“I’m out here, ma.” I said. I grabbed a broom and dustpan. “I’ll clean this up.”</p>
<p>	“Thank you, jàre.” She opened the door. “Wake your sister and take her with you.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The sun was bearing down hard when Titi and I stepped onto Cinema Road. She was wearing a Sly Fox & Red Hen branded frock and new rubber sandals, both of which Grandmother bought for her when dad sent money home for her birthday. I held her arm firmly with my left hand and kept the bag of fish tucked under the other arm. Her hair had been spun in several strands with rubber threads the night before, so that her head resembled a huge mace ball. Grandmother did that every week afternoon at her sister-in-law’s stall in the market. She claimed the felicity of the market made hair grow.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Titi said. “I forgot today is Ìyá Alátẹ’s burial.”</p>
<p>“I remembered. I even saw her last night.”</p>
<p>Her mouth was agape. “How? Why didn’t you call me?”</p>
<p>“You and Grandmother were still at the market. I just ran to the house when they brought her from the mortuary. The ambulance brought her and it was making that police noise.”</p>
<p>We weaved through two cobblers shuffling in flip flops along the sandy sidewalk. The road was beginning to teem with people, and most of them were setting up the venue for our neighbour’s funeral party -- Cinema Road itself. Loudspeakers and a stage for the band had arrived the previous night. Soon, they would erect canopies and tables and chairs, which would be filled with people soaked in merriment, and stray dogs hacking away at discarded chunks of undercooked goat meat under the tables. But Fatai wasn’t like the other dogs. The noise might probably make him stay away. Perhaps he would come around in the morning. In the meantime, beaten down Datsun hatchbacks, painted green and yellow, zoomed past each other on the now narrow lanes, each hauling baskets of yams and onions, sacks of rice and gaari, or dozens of chickens tied together and screaming their heads off. I imagined the drivers were in a rush to make as many trips to and from the market before the party shut the road down for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>“Does she still have those scary eyes?” she prodded.</p>
<p>“She’s dead, Titi. Her eyes were not open.”</p>
<p>“Eh!? But the people in those Chinese films don’t close their eyes when they die.”</p>
<p>“Haha. Those are just films, Titi. Everybody closes their eyes when they die. Even Mom did.”</p>
<p>I bit my tongue as soon as the words slipped out. But she said nothing, not even when we passed the butcher’s signboard she always pointed and laughed at. It was the painting of a dead goat laying in a huge plate, wearing a brown three-piece suit that was striped unevenly with blood, with forks and knives on either side.  IMPORTED ÒGÚFE, the sign said. We kept walking but I could imagine her eyes clouding up. No one had told her how Mom died, or when, but talk of it made her cry without fail. She probably knew, seeing as we never talked about them together. As we turned off Cinema Road and neared the market, a Jing Cheng motorcycle that had been approaching at top speed rushed into a puddle beside us and drenched us. The rider, a Hausa man in a billowing dashiki, manoeuvred his way out of the pothole and zoomed off, managing to keep his balance with a cow propped astride on the front seat, front hooves hanging off the handlebars between the rider’s grip, while the motorcycle grunted and belched smoke as it laboured under their weight. As I collected myself from the shock, Titi flew into a rage and yelled curses after him.</p>
<p>	“Hey! It’s okay,” I said as I gripped her shoulders and turned her to face me. Her face was swollen and her eyes bloodshot. “It’s okay,” I said again. That’s what the adults said all the time, at least. “It’s okay. Stop crying.” She held on to me.</p>
<p>	“Is Daddy going to die too?”</p>
<p>	Ah! “No, he won’t. He’s… he’s safe. He will be safe. Nothing will happen to him. Please stop crying.”</p>
<p>	“I don’t want him to die.”</p>
<p>	“He won’t die, Titi. I promise.”</p>
<p>	She nodded, then pulled up the hem of my shirt and blew her nose in it.</p>
<p>	“Good girl. Let’s go now. Aunty Afusa is waiting for us.”</p>
<p>***</p>
    </section>
<aside class ="col2">
<p>Aunty Afusa, Kokonsari’s wife, was a nurse, who also sold bean cakes and fried fish at the market. She was an imposing woman with very large breasts that always looked inconveniently squeezed together in her trademark extra-large Che Guevara branded t-shirts. Heads turned, eyes rolled and whistles blew whenever she bent over to turn the fish and bean cakes in the oil, and men made a big deal about her not wearing a bra. Then, I didn’t know how to tell if a woman had on a bra or not, but I could never quite keep my eyes off Che Guevara.</p>
<p>	“Heeeey! My babies are here o!” she rushed forward and hugged us. She called Titi and me her babies because she had no children, not after eight years of marriage to my uncle. There were several competing rumours, but the frontrunner was that she joined a coven and traded her womb for good looks. Others said Kokonsari could not act like a man. Most rumours started at the market, yet she pretended not to know about them. I prostrated and handed her the bag.</p>
<p>	“This is a lot,” she said when she peered inside. “Hope you two haven’t had breakfast?”</p>
<p>	We shook our heads.</p>
<p>	“Oh good. I told your grandmother I would feed you this morning.” She handed me a five naira note. “Get a loaf of bread for you and your sister. I’ll fry some of this fish for you.”</p>
<p>The woman who sold bread had skins of small animals drying out on a concrete slab outside her stall, none of them bigger than Titi’s slate. I know a lot of muslims owned animal skins that they took to the neighbourhood mosque for prayers. But how tiny did someone have to be to use skins this small as a prayer mat? I took a loaf from the woman and handed her the money, yet kept staring at the skins.</p>
<p>“Those are cat skins,” she said. “You like them?”</p>
<p>I turned to her. “Are they going to be sewn together?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “No need for that.”</p>
<p>“Who is going to use them?”</p>
<p>“The vigilantes. They are ingredients for amulets. Ayeta, to ward off bullets.”</p>
<p>“But… they are so small.”</p>
<p>“Yes. In fact, the smaller the better. The young ones haven’t spent too much of their lives, so they make much stronger charms. Still full of life. But cats don’t mate much around here. And when they do, they make only one or two. I had to go to Mile 12 in Lagos to get these kittens.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” Aunty Afusa said when I returned and told her about the skins, as she casually removed a sodden piece of plaster from the badly bruised knee of a boy sitting on a stool inside her stall. He looked older than me, and huffed and puffed, exhaling through his teeth. “You don’t know, but soldiers can just decide tomorrow to come into town and start arresting and killing innocent people.” She grabbed a pair of tongs. “So our vigilantes need protection if they have to fight.”</p>
<p>I dried my palms and and clenched my fists and inhaled. Mom said the same thing several times before she died. I sat on the floor and breathed quietly. Titi was outside, chasing a hen around with a handful of corn. I wanted to take her and go where Dad went. He didn’t trust his amulets to keep him protected in Sagamu. I trusted him. I wanted to take Titi and go where he was.</p>
<p>“And don’t forget that gambaris live in our town,” Aunty Afusa continued. “Who knows what they are...”</p>
<p>The boy groaned.</p>
<p>“Fem!” she snapped. “Better hush it. This would teach you to avoid rough play.”</p>
<p>His cloudy eyes offered something of a plea. She finished cleaning the wound and put on a fresh piece of plaster. “Come back tomorrow evening. And tell your mother she owes me twenty naira now.”</p>
<p>We sat on her straw mat to eat, while Aunty Afusa watched us. I split the bread and gave Titi the smaller half, then lit a candle and held my half of the loaf over the flame, watching the fluffy white inside darken. My eyes half closed as I inhaled the burning smell of the toast, and could have stayed that way all day, as long as I could keep my sights on Che. </p>
<p>Across from Aunty Afusa’s stall, in front of the stagnant gutter where he had drained gallons of blood, a man turned a headless goat over, stretching its limbs with one hand and holding a thin air hose firmly inside the animal with the other. I thought how that goat must have gotten up that morning with no idea he was soon going to be swelling with air like a balloon and without a head, even with everyone talking about killing it for days. The man drenched the goat in boiling water and began to shave it with a razor. His wife wiped down tables and benches in the shack behind him. I wondered if the goat had a wife. Did they have children? Had they been killed and eaten too? Why couldn’t animals understand what people said. I imagined they’d all run away if they did. Fatai seemed to understand the things I said, though. Ever since I told him Sagamu people didn’t eat dogs, he stayed around. But even he couldn’t help me with the kittens. I wrapped a piece of the fried fish with an old newspaper and stuffed it in my pocket. </p>
<p>A FOOD IS READY sign hung above the door of the shack. In a humongous iron pot, the aroma of gbẹgìrì escaped, mixed with smoke from the firewood and diffused over the market. Somewhere off in the distance, Hausa beggars sang and jiggled their coin bowls.</p>
<p>	Everyone’s radio was tuned to 93.5 FM, even though Ọláwuyì wasn’t to come on for another two hours. He told, complete with exclusive interviews, the latest juicy stories of ritual killings and kidnappings and made them sound like fairy tales. The week before, it was about two college students who were arrested for murdering their albino friend, and selling his head, liver and colon to Egun witchdoctors at the Seme border.</p>
<p>“They were paid millions,” Olawuyi said sprightly. “Milliiiooooooooooooooons!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>By nightfall, Cinema Road’s pulse could be felt throughout the neighbourhood. The adjacent streets juddered from the beats of jazz and talking drums, keyboard chords complemented rattling beaded gourds, and the bandleader’s fruity tenor juiced up the throng of revelers that crowded the dance floor. He was singing the praises of Iya Alate’s first son, who was manically  dancing and sticking naira notes to the singer’s forehead.</p>
<p>	I took a piece of meat from my plate and slid it into my pocket, scanning the table to see that no one was watching. Titi was absently gorging on jollof rice next to MC Hammer, the head of Sagamu Security Council, the local vigilante group. My uncle and I sat across from them. Grandmother couldn’t attend the party because Iya Alate had been younger than her, so she’d left us in my uncle’s care and told us to be home by nine.</p>
<p>	Our table was packed with several other people I didn’t recognize, but I knew they were OPC guys from Lagos. Kokonsari had told me that they wore two square rings on their fingers, while local vigilantes wore only one. One of them wore a face cap with MKO’s picture and “June 12” written across it. He was the center of their conversation, gesturing wildly and causing the men to nod whenever he finished a sentence.</p>
<p>“But we don’t have enough guys in Sagamu,” MC Hammer said. “We’ll be really short handed.”</p>
<p>“It’s just for a week, MC.” He took off his cap and wiped his brow. “I understand your situation. That’s why I’m only taking fifteen from you. Every other town around here is giving up twenty men. Even Abeokuta had to give me thirty.” He pointed at Kokonsari, who had raised his hand.</p>
<p>“Oga, what will happen if they need to stay longer than a week?”</p>
<p>	“Nobody needs more than week to sneak hundred trucks across the border.”</p>
<p>	“But if...”</p>
<p>	“Hey hey! Listen to me, everybody. The weapons we’re bringing in is for everybody’s benefit. OPC is taking the risk because we’re at the forefront in Lagos, and all our people must be in this together. Do you want us to just open our eyes and let Abacha throw pepper in it?”</p>
<p>	The talking drums filled the space for a few seconds.</p>
<p>	“Look,” he continued. “I need capable people. We need them now.”</p>
<p>	Everyone slowly nodded.</p>
<p>	“Good. So what about amulets? Do your people have enough?”</p>
<p>	I got up and told Kokonsari I needed to piss. Titi was now at another table, collecting crown corks with one of Iya Alate’s grandchildren. The moon was full - mom always said it meant good luck. I ran home and walked quickly to Dad’s car, gingerly opening the door, careful to make as little noise as possible, and lifted the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>	Twelve eyes sparkled innocently from the backseat, following my motions as I felt around the roof for a switch. Strangely, the lights in the car still worked, despite having been parked there for a few years. The kittens didn’t seem disturbed. They just stared as if they were waiting for me to say something. I took the fish and meat out of my pocket, tore them up, and put the pieces in the plate I’d served them powdered milk in the day before.</p>
<p>	“Abacha is going to be killed soon,” I said to them. “Then nobody will need to kill you for charms. Just pray it happens quickly, ok?”</p>
<p>	They kept staring. One of them sniffed the food. Perhaps they needed me to leave so they could eat. I turned off the light and closed the door.</p>
