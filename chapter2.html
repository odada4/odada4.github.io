    <h2>CHAPTER TWO</h2>
    <section  class="col1">
    <p>Grandmother smacked me over the head with her thick linen wrapper and tapped my feet. She knew I was already awake. I chuckled and sat up lazily, watching her dance to Majek Fashek’s Send Down the Rain. The DJ must have been psychic that morning -- the sky had been rumbling all night, punctuated every two hours by the Muezzin belting out the early morning Adhān like an aria on a minaret, and nocturnal birds chirping maliciously as they ransacked the tipped-over garbage cans in the yard.</p>
<p>My chuckle grew into laughter as she swung her arms back and forth, gently swinging and bending her waist as low as her septuagenarian knees could support it. I held out my hands and let her draw me to her. Grandmother was always less rigid and stern on the weekends. She would let me stay in bed longer and wake us only after she had prepared breakfast. All I had to do the whole day was iron our clothes after we ate. And since school was on break through Monday, I could do it even later. Her arms sent a shudder down my back -- cold as always.</p>
<p>	This morning I’ve been sowing my seed/waiting for the rain…, we sang along, holding on to each other, knowing our little noise wasn’t enough to wake Titi, who had even stretched across the bed and taken up my spot.</p>
<p>	“Your sister sleeps like a corpse,” Grandmother said as we danced.</p>
<p>“Jesus spends too much power resurrecting her every morning.”</p>
<p>She laughed nervously. “Don’t ever let her hear that.”</p>
<p>Grandmother was always wary of hurting Titi’s feelings, but she was also quick to whip out a cane or stick or whatever she could lay her hands on if the need ever arose.</p>
<p>Please send down the rain/to water up my seed…</p>
<p>I rested my temple on her left breast and wrapped my arms around her, letting her lower her head and exhale on mine. We were now rocking slowly. She did this when she was proclaiming the day’s blessings on us, her words pouring down our earlobes like a sneaky stream. People called Grandmother a prayer warrior, and I sometimes envisioned her in a velvet cape, fighting seven-headed machine gun toting monsters with nothing but her bible and silky voice. She would command them to flee -- to hands off her family. Occasionally she went on a bender and rattled off psalm after psalm. She was vicious.</p>
<p>Titi loved these prayers except when Grandmother mentioned Dad. She was only three when he left and hardly remembered what he looked like. Everything she knew about him was what Grandmother and Kokonsari told her. Stories like how he had won the Lagos marathon in 1976, barefoot and in spite of the rains and slippery roads and thorny brushes. That had earned him the nickname Ologini -- the cat. I only heard the name used once, when he took me along while campaigning for M.K.O. in Lagos before June 12.</p>
<p>I decided I would ask him for advice about the kittens when we spoke to him again, but that wouldn’t be for another two weeks - he called every third Sunday of the month, around six in the evening. Grandmother would take Titi and me in a taxi up to the NITEL office to receive his call. But I wasn’t even sure he would say anything different from what I already knew. He could even tell grandmother, who would flog me for hiding them in the car without her knowing, and then give them away to the vigilantes.</p>
<p>I once watched MC Hammer kill a cat to make an amulet. He tied up the wriggling creature in a sack with rocks and spun it over his head viciously until the cat stopped meowing.</p>
<p>“It’s dazed,” he grunted through a smug grin as he continued spinning. Suddenly he brought the sack down on the concrete floor without dropping momentum. The stones crushed and the sack bounced once. I winced. But the cat was silent.</p>
<p>“It has to die without a sound,” he said as he fished the bloodied thing out of the sack and snapped its joints. “If it cries, the charm would be impotent.”</p>
<p>Send down the rain/send down the raaaaaain…</p>

<p>Kokonsari came to the house around noon. He said his head felt heavy from all the drinking from the previous night. Too heavy for him to look up or handle a gun, so I hopped in his car and we drove to Sabo to buy some suya for lunch. He drove in silence, munching on a chewing stick and humming intermittently. I was tempted to ask him what the vigilantes were going to do if they couldn’t find enough cats to make amulets. The man at the party had said that there was a shortage even in Lagos.</p>
<p>I had returned to Dad’s car to give the kittens milk when Grandmother left her cupboard open that morning, and they looked quite content to me. But because I was worried that someone could see them from outside, I rubbed mud on the windows, even though they were already thick with caked sand, crumbled bark and bat shit. They still held on to traces dust from the dwindling harmattan, which also left a thin whitish frosting on the car’s body. The tires were becoming threadbare and had begun sinking into the moist earth under the car. It had been parked in that spot for a few years -- after Mom died but before M.K.O. was thrown in the slammer and Dad went into exile. Not very long after June 12.</p>
<p>	“Why did these people come here all the way from the north?” I asked instead, proud to show off my knowledge of Nigeria’s geography. I wondered where these wretched looking people I was seeing kept their loot. When my social studies teacher mentioned in class that Hausas were from the north, I envisioned a desert full of thatched huts where people starved like we saw in the pictures of children from Rwanda. I was also puzzled because I’d heard adults talk about northerners “stealing” the country’s wealth and “dominating” the people from other regions. Sabo didn’t look very much different from the other neighbourhoods in Sagamu, but it was packed like a hen house, and it was very hot. Smelly too. </p>
<p>“That is what they do,” Kokonsari replied, managing to keep his chewing stick from falling out. “They go wherever they want and stay there for as long as they want.”</p>
<p>“So why do we let them stay here?”</p>
<p>He shrugged and shook his head. The car slowed as we reached a junction, and then crossed over the curb onto the adjoining road. He stepped on the clutch and pushed the stick into second gear as we rode past the Sabo mosque.</p>
<p>“They put MKO in prison,” I pressed.</p>
<p>“Abacha put MKO in prison.”</p>
<p>“But he is Hausa, and he has been killing and putting Yoruba people in prison just because he is an army officer.”</p>
<p>“You’re right.”</p>
<p>“So we… and we still let them live in our town?”</p>
<p>He sighed. “You are too young to be angry over this, Bobo,” he said, and scratched my head. I didn’t like being called Bobo. But he was the only one who called me that, so I saw no harm. He flicked the chewing stick to one side of his mouth and spat out the window through the other. And then he muttered something about me being just like my father.</p>
<p>“I know it’s hard for you children to see all this happening at your age.”</p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p>“You know… sometimes I think we should not have brought you into this mess.”</p>
<p>I eyed him askance. “Mom needed children. Grandmother would have found another wife for Dad if she didn’t have us.”</p>
<p>He shrugged. “I know. But where is your mother now?”</p>
<p>I turned from him and chewed my nails. Even though I knew he didn’t say that to hurt me, I didn’t appreciate anyone talking about Mom that way.</p>
<p>Kokonsari scratched my head again. “It’s okay,” he said. “It’s not your fault.”</p>
<p>I didn’t say much for the rest of the day. Sometimes, in my sleep, I saw gambaris living their lives unperturbed unless they had to flee during a riot or got killed while trying to flee. They often frequented Solution’s barbershop, which also doubled as a bar -- the vigilantes’ favourite; they treaded the footpath to Sonariwo Market and hung out under old Pampers billboard with the pitiful looking baby. Sometimes they window-shopped at the bookstore across from the boarded-up cinema. They trampled all over the town and returned to Sabo at night. They all prayed in the nice mosque with the tall minaret, which dominated the skyline along with the TV antennas sticking out of everybody’s roof -- twenty foot iron poles crowned with four-litre plastic kegs, each crisscrossed with two long fluorescent tubes.</p>
<p>The highway that led to Lagos opened up in Sabo. I wondered how far beyond that Dad was. All I was certain of was that he had gone to the airport in Lagos and flown away on a plane. When I asked Grandmother, she seemed agitated and didn’t respond, so I assumed his whereabouts was being kept secret. Then I overheard Kokonsari say something about him being in Abroad. But when I checked the atlas in our school library, Abroad wasn’t in any of the maps. Maybe it was a new country. Mr Sada had told us in class that the atlas was from 1965, and that there had been some new countries since then. Abroad was definitely a new country, I decided. It was the sensible place to go. Not an old country that everyone knew.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The rain began after lunch. My uncle had left, and I was loading charcoal into the pressing iron in Grandmother’s room. The Inspector Gadget theme song was playing on the TV in the living room, with Titi humming along. I imagined her head bobbing up and down between Grandmother’s thighs while Grandmother tried to keep her steady, yanking her hair up and down with a wooden comb and weaving it into thin plaits. She would soon come looking for me to show it off; grinning, rubbing her palms together and mock genuflecting, begging me in whispers to sing Ahayye Yaro to her. It used to be Mom’s favourite song. She loved singing it with me because, she said, I pronounced the Hausa words well, even though I didn’t know what they meant. And I always wondered how a Hausa song could sound so nice. But Grandmother said it was the noise of nomadic animals, “a song for cows and donkeys,” and forbade us from ever singing it.</p>
<p>	I set the iron down on its butt and sat on the bed with my back to the bedpost, waiting for the heat to spread through the metal. When Fatai was around, he would bark twice when it became hot enough. It always surprised me how he knew a lot of things. I had wanted to keep him the first time he strayed into yard, but Dad had refused. He said “the best dog is its own master,” and I never really understood what that meant. But Fatai came and went when he wanted, and always looked healthy, except when he was hungry and started sniffing the trash cans where Grandmother dumped fish guts. So Dad was probably right. And he would have sniffed out the kittens and drawn attention to them if he was around. Dad was definitely right.</p>
<p>The three o’clock Adhān came on. I could hear it very clearly, even as the tin roof above rattled chaotically under the downpour. When we were bored and Grandmother was out of earshot, Titi and I would croon it to each other between snickers. Sometimes, whispering it to myself helped when I couldn’t fall asleep. Through the window, I could see our yard, which faced Cinema Road with Grandmother’s mango tree, which canopied dad’s car, and a bamboo-fenced garden where little was planted besides a bunch of ailing banana trees and ewédú stalks. There was an outhouse beside the garden. And a little farther from the outhouse was a small thatched shed where Mom used to sit and chat with her friends in the evenings. She used to be there. Why couldn’t she just be there.</p>
<p>	Ash-hadu al-la ilaha illa llah aha-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aaaahru! I grunted quietly along, exhaling. Grandmother was snoring. Titi must be asleep too. I dozed off slowly.</p>
<p>	Hayyya ‘alasss-salaha-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aaaahru!</p>
